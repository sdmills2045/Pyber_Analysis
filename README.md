#Pyber-Analysis
Module 5 Challenge
## Overview of Project
Pyber has been working on an in-depth analysis for its ride sharing services. They have taken a close look at total number of rides, fares collected and demographics. 
### Analysis Results	
This final analysis brings this data together in one snapshot:



As we can see by this snapshot the ridesharing in early 2019 is consistent within each category type. It stands to reason that more population equals more ride share business. The graph above is consistent with this idea. My recommendations would be targeted towards profitability. 
###Analysis Summary
Recommendation 1: Is data available that would determine if the ridge share is profitable? Business is consistent but is the company making money?
Recommendation 2: Can the changes in volume be attributed to any specific factors? Did weather play a role? Did weekday verses weekend play a role?
Recommendation 3: What has been the driver availability? Are fares missed due to lack of drivers? Did drivers get paid when no business was available?
